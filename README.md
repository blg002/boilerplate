# Framework

My personal starting files for a new www site. They help you to avoid the repetitive boring tasks and allow you to get right to the good stuff (whatever that may be).

This is *largely* inspired/copied from [Paul Irish's HTML5-Boilerplate](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/). If you have any questions about what's going on in these files I'd suggest checking out [his wiki](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/wiki).
